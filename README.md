ECE290-2nd-Project
==================

Multiple 2D games played on 8x8 LED board using Arduino

In my ECE290 class, we were given free range to create a project that implemented the concepts we were learning.
My team and I chose to create multiple 2D games, which took inputs from four buttons that went to an Arduino microcontroller and then outputed onto an 8x8 LED display.

This is the Arduino code for the games as well as a small clip demonstrating our project.
